# Code Pod Website - Style Guide

## HTML & CSS

The website uses the Google HTML and CSS style guide as the basis of it's style recommendations for HTML and CSS.  This guide can be found [here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html).

This repo includes a .editorconfig file specifying some rules that are consistent with this guide.  Editorconfig automatically enforces some styles within your code editor (for example, in our config all tabs will be enforced as 2 spaces).  You may have to download a plugin for this to work within your code editor.  Please visit [editorconfig.org](editorconfig.org) for more details.


## JavaScript

The website uses the Airbnb javascript style guide, which can be found [here](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).  Please note that this style guide prefers ES6 syntax in places.  Accordingly, JavaScript code will be transpiled by a build tool.  

ESlint rules that follow this style guide have been incorporated in this repo.  Most code editors will allow you to run linting inside the editor.  This will give you instant feedback as to whether you are following the required styles.
